# `Django Signals Learning`

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and understanding Django signals, including both built-in and custom signals.

### Built-in Signals

To explore the built-in signals, navigate to the `signalapp` directory. Inside, you'll find a file named `signals.py` which contains various types of Django signals.

### Custom Signals

For custom signals, check out the `customsignal` directory. This section focuses on the creation and usage of custom signals in Django.
